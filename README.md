# Automated Jitsi test thing (name subject to change)
A wrapper for the Jitsi web API, which auto-joins the room and reloads if there are errors. When used with electron with a HDMI CEC device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) it will automatically switch input when a participant joins the call.

Try it out (without HDMI switching of course): https://jackalstew.github.io/managed-meet/client.html
